Introduction to Cerberus Protocol
=================================

![Cerberus Protocol Overview](/assets/introduction.png)

## What is the Cerberus Protocol?

The Cerberus Protocol is a comprehensive security framework designed for organizations seeking institutional-grade cryptocurrency custody with a multisignature (multisig) setup. Named after the three-headed guardian of the underworld in Greek mythology, Cerberus employs a 2-of-3 multisignature arrangement, where transactions require approval from at least two of three designated signatories.

## Why Use the Cerberus Protocol?

Traditional single-signature cryptocurrency wallets present a significant risk: a single point of failure. If the private key is compromised, all funds can be immediately stolen. The Cerberus Protocol eliminates this vulnerability through:

* **Distributed Security**: No single person can unilaterally move funds
* **Redundancy**: The system remains operational even if one key is lost or a signatory is unavailable
* **Operational Resilience**: Clear procedures ensure business continuity regardless of personnel changes
* **Physical Security**: Multiple layers of protection for both hardware and recovery information
* **Procedural Controls**: Well-defined roles and processes that minimize human error

## Protocol Structure

The Cerberus Protocol is organized into sections that guide your organization through the entire implementation process:

1. **Introduction** (current section): Overview of the protocol and its purpose
2. **Preparation**: Required resources, team assembly, and preliminary setup tasks
3. **Setup Ceremony**: Step-by-step procedure for establishing the multisig wallet
4. **Transaction Procedures**: Instructions for initiating and approving transactions
5. **Recovery Procedures**: Guidelines for addressing lost hardware wallets or seed phrases
6. **Emergency Protocols**: Procedures for handling security breaches or signatory unavailability
7. **Key Rotation Procedures**: Process for periodically updating the multisig arrangement
8. **Security Best Practices**: Ongoing measures to maintain system integrity
9. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Solutions for common technical issues
10. **Glossary**: Definitions of technical terms
11. **Appendix**: Background information and extended explanations

## Core Principles

Throughout the implementation of the Cerberus Protocol, adherence to these core principles is essential:

* **Separation of Duties**: No single individual should have complete control or knowledge
* **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against different types of threats
* **Procedural Discipline**: Strict adherence to documented procedures prevents shortcuts
* **Physical Security**: Both hardware wallets and recovery information must be physically secured
* **Verifiable Execution**: All critical steps must be observable and independently verifiable
* **Minimal Complexity**: Procedures are designed to be as simple as possible while maintaining security

## Required Resources

Implementing the Cerberus Protocol requires:

* Three trusted individuals within your organization (signatories)
* Hardware wallets (Trezor One)
* Laptop computers for each signatory
* Secure physical storage (home safes and safe deposit boxes)
* Approximately 8-10 hours total time commitment (preparation and setup)
* Various supplementary equipment (detailed in the Preparation section)

## Implementation Path

Implementing the Cerberus Protocol follows this sequence:

1. **Review**: Start with the [0. Overview & Quick Reference](/0_quick_reference.md) to understand the complete protocol structure
2. **Prepare**: Follow the detailed steps in the [2. Preparation](/2_preparation.md) section to assemble your team and equipment
3. **Establish**: Execute the [3. Setup Ceremony](/3_setup_ceremony.md) to create your secure multisignature wallet
4. **Operate**: Use the [4. Transaction Procedures](/4_transaction_procedures.md) for day-to-day operations
5. **Maintain**: Implement [8. Security Best Practices](/9_security_best_practices.md) and follow [7. Key Rotation Procedures](/8_key_rotation_procedures.md) regularly

If you encounter unfamiliar terminology, consult the [12. Glossary](/10_glossary.md) section.

**Note:** The Cerberus Protocol is designed for organizations with significant cryptocurrency holdings. For individuals or organizations with smaller holdings, simpler security measures may be more appropriate.
