Security Best Practices
=====================

![Security Best Practices](/assets/security.png)

This chapter outlines essential security practices for maintaining the long-term integrity of your Cerberus Protocol multisig wallet. These practices extend beyond the technical configuration to encompass operational security, physical security, and human factors.

## 1. Operational Security

* [ ] **1.1. Signatory management**

* Regularly review the status and trustworthiness of all signatories
* Consider rotating signatory roles annually
* Ensure signatories understand the importance of immediately reporting any security concerns
* Maintain clear documentation of who serves in each role

* [ ] **1.2. Transaction discipline**

* Always verify destination addresses through multiple channels
* Never rush transactions, even for "urgent" business needs
* Maintain detailed logs of all transactions
* Periodically review transaction logs for patterns or anomalies
* Enforce dual control for all transactions without exception

* [ ] **1.3. Regular security reviews**

* Conduct quarterly reviews of all security procedures
* Verify all signatories are following protocols correctly
* Update procedures to address any identified weaknesses
* Document each review and actions taken

***

## 2. Physical Security

* [ ] **2.1. Hardware wallet protection**

* Store hardware wallets in a locked container when not in use
* Consider using a Faraday bag for protection against radio-based attacks
* Inspect hardware wallets for signs of tampering before each use
* Never leave hardware wallets unattended in public or shared spaces
* Avoid exposing hardware wallets to extreme temperatures or moisture

* [ ] **2.2. Seed phrase protection**

* Verify the security of safe deposit boxes quarterly
* Consider using metal seed storage solutions for fire resistance
* Never store seed phrases digitally or take photographs of them
* Verify tamper-evident bags remain intact during each visit
* Consider splitting seed phrases across multiple locations for critical holdings

* [ ] **2.3. Secure locations**

* Maintain a list of pre-approved secure locations for conducting transactions
* Verify these locations remain free of surveillance cameras
* Avoid discussing wallet details in public spaces or near smart devices
* Be aware of shoulder-surfing when entering PINs or reviewing seed phrases

***

## 3. Digital Security

* [ ] **3.1. Software management**

* Keep Electrum and other wallet software updated to the latest version
* Verify software authenticity with PGP signatures before each update
* Consider using a dedicated computer for cryptocurrency transactions
* Never install untrusted software on computers used for wallet management

* [ ] **3.2. Network security**

* Consider using a VPN when conducting transactions
* Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks for wallet access
* Consider keeping transaction computers entirely offline except when needed
* Disable Bluetooth, NFC, and other wireless technologies during sensitive operations

* [ ] **3.3. Protection against malware**

* Run up-to-date antivirus software on all computers used for wallet access
* Consider using a Linux live boot USB for transactions to prevent persistent malware
* Be extremely cautious with email attachments and downloads
* Regularly scan for keyloggers and other financial malware

***

## 4. Human Security Factors

* [ ] **4.1. Social engineering awareness**

* Train all signatories to recognize social engineering attempts
* Establish verification procedures for unusual requests
* Never discuss seed phrases, PINs, or wallet details over phone or email
* Be suspicious of urgent requests that bypass normal procedures

* [ ] **4.2. Duress protocols**

* Establish duress signals that signatories can use if under coercion
* Create plausible deniability for safe deposit box contents
* Consider having a small "decoy" wallet that could be surrendered under duress
* Establish procedures to follow if a signatory reports being under duress

* [ ] **4.3. Knowledge management**

* Maintain need-to-know restrictions for wallet details
* Ensure executives understand the security model without unnecessary technical details
* Document the system sufficiently for recovery but avoid creating a single point of failure
* Consider legal arrangements for access in case of signatory death or incapacitation

***

## 5. Cryptocurrency-Specific Security

* [ ] **5.1. Address verification**

* Always use the full address verification feature on hardware wallets
* Compare addresses character-by-character, not just visually
* Be aware of address substitution malware and verify through multiple channels
* Consider using QR codes for address entry to avoid typing errors

* [ ] **5.2. Transaction safety**

* Start with small test transactions to new addresses
* Be aware of network fees and adjust appropriately based on urgency
* Understand transaction finality for your cryptocurrency (confirmation requirements)
* Monitor transactions until fully confirmed

* [ ] **5.3. Chain split handling**

* Develop a clear policy for handling cryptocurrency forks
* Determine in advance which chains the organization will support
* Understand replay protection issues before transacting after a fork
* Consider dedicated wallets for fork claiming to isolate risk

***

## 6. Security Training and Awareness

* [ ] **6.1. Regular training**

* Conduct security refresher training for signatories quarterly
* Simulate various attack scenarios and practice appropriate responses
* Keep signatories updated on new cryptocurrency threats and vulnerabilities
* Review incident response procedures regularly

* [ ] **6.2. Awareness testing**

* Consider periodic "friendly" phishing tests for signatories
* Practice emergency response procedures through simulations
* Test physical security awareness through authorized "attempts"
* Provide feedback and additional training based on results

* [ ] **6.3. Security culture**

* Recognize and reward security-conscious behavior
* Encourage reporting of security concerns without fear of reprisal
* Promote asking questions when procedures are unclear
* Ensure the organization values security over convenience or speed

***

## 7. Wallet Maintenance

* [ ] **7.1. Regular testing**

* Conduct monthly tests of wallet access
* Verify all signatories can still access the wallet
* Test the signing process with small transactions
* Verify that balances display correctly

* [ ] **7.2. Backup verification**

* Periodically verify backup procedures work as expected
* Consider partial test restores from seed phrases (on air-gapped devices)
* Verify that emergency access procedures remain viable
* Update documentation based on any changes to the system

* [ ] **7.3. Clean wallet management**

* Maintain address hygiene by using fresh addresses for each deposit
* Consider periodic consolidation of UTXOs (unspent transaction outputs)
* Keep transaction history organized and documented
* Consider privacy implications of wallet address reuse

***

## 8. Continuous Improvement

* [ ] **8.1. Threat intelligence**

* Monitor cryptocurrency security news and forums
* Subscribe to security advisories for relevant hardware and software
* Join industry groups focused on cryptocurrency security
* Engage with the broader security community

* [ ] **8.2. Security assessments**

* Consider annual security reviews by external experts
* Implement recommendations from security assessments
* Track security metrics and improvements over time
* Benchmark against industry best practices

* [ ] **8.3. Protocol evolution**

* Review and update the Cerberus Protocol annually
* Incorporate lessons learned from operations
* Adapt to changes in the threat landscape
* Consider new security technologies as they mature
