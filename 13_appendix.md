![Appendix](/assets/appendix.png)

This appendix provides background information, rationales, and extended explanations for various components of the Cerberus Protocol. It is designed to help participants understand the reasoning behind specific security measures and procedures.

## 1. Multisignature Technology Explained

### 1.1. What is multisignature?

Multisignature (often abbreviated as "multisig") is a digital signature scheme that requires multiple parties to authorize a transaction before it can be executed. Unlike traditional cryptocurrency wallets where a single private key controls the funds, multisignature wallets distribute control across multiple keys.

The Cerberus Protocol implements a 2-of-3 multisignature arrangement, meaning:
* Three separate keys (belonging to three separate signatories) are associated with the wallet
* Any transaction requires signatures from at least two of these keys
* No single key can unilaterally move funds

### 1.2. Technical implementation

At the blockchain level, multisignature is implemented using a special type of script that defines the conditions under which funds can be spent. For Bitcoin, this is typically a "Pay to Script Hash" (P2SH) address that contains a redeem script specifying:
* The total number of possible signatories (3 in our case)
* The required threshold for authorization (2 in our case)
* The public keys of all authorized signatories

When a transaction is created, it must include valid signatures matching at least two of the public keys specified in the original redeem script.

### 1.3. Security advantages

Multisignature provides several key security advantages:
* **Elimination of single points of failure**: Even if one key is compromised, funds remain secure
* **Protection against internal threats**: No individual can act alone, reducing insider risks
* **Redundancy**: The system remains functional even if one key is lost or inaccessible
* **Separation of duties**: Different organizational roles can be required for transaction approval
* **Geographic distribution**: Keys can be stored in different physical locations, protecting against localized threats

***

## 2. Hardware Wallet Technology

### 2.1. The role of hardware wallets

Hardware wallets are physical devices specifically designed to securely store cryptocurrency private keys. They serve as a critical security component by:
* Keeping private keys offline (never exposing them to internet-connected devices)
* Requiring physical confirmation of transactions (via button press)
* Providing tamper-resistant hardware security
* Isolating keys from potentially compromised computers

### 2.2. Why Trezor One?

The Cerberus Protocol specifies Trezor One hardware wallets for several reasons:
* **Open source design**: Both hardware and firmware are open source, allowing security verification
* **Established security track record**: In use since 2014 with strong security history
* **Simplicity**: Straightforward user interface reduces operational errors
* **Compatibility**: Well-supported by Electrum for multisignature operations
* **Affordability**: Reasonable cost allows for backup devices without excessive expense
* **PIN protection**: Prevents unauthorized access to the device
* **Factory reset protection**: Wipes device after multiple incorrect PIN attempts

### 2.3. Hardware security limitations

While hardware wallets provide substantial security benefits, they are not invulnerable. The Cerberus Protocol acknowledges these limitations and implements additional measures to address them:
* **Physical security**: Protection against theft or tampering
* **Supply chain attacks**: Verification of device authenticity
* **Social engineering**: Clear procedures to prevent manipulation of signatories
* **Firmware vulnerabilities**: Regular updates and verification procedures

***

## 3. Operational Security Design Principles

### 3.1. Defense in depth

The Cerberus Protocol implements multiple layers of defense:
* **Physical security**: Hardware wallets, seed phrases in safe deposit boxes, privacy boards
* **Digital security**: Offline signing, multisignature requirements
* **Procedural security**: Documented processes, verification steps, dual control
* **Human security**: Training, awareness, clear role definitions

This layered approach ensures that a failure in any single security control does not compromise the entire system.

### 3.2. Separation of duties

Separation of duties is a fundamental security principle that prevents any single individual from having excessive control. The Cerberus Protocol implements this through:
* **Distinct signatory roles**: Initiator, verifier, and backup
* **Physical separation**: Different storage locations for hardware wallets and seed phrases
* **Transaction verification**: Multiple independent verifications of transaction details
* **Key storage**: Distributed across multiple individuals and locations

### 3.3. Minimize attack surface

The protocol carefully restricts exposure to potential attacks:
* **Limiting internet connectivity**: Transactions created offline when possible
* **Verified software**: Using only authenticated and verified software
* **Minimal complexity**: Simplified procedures to reduce errors and attack vectors
* **Need-to-know information**: Restricting sensitive details to only those who require them

***

## 4. Physical Security Measures

### 4.1. Safe deposit boxes

Safe deposit boxes are specified for seed phrase storage because they provide:
* **Professional physical security**: Armed guards, surveillance, access controls
* **Environmental protection**: Protection from fire, flood, and other environmental hazards
* **Legal protections**: Regulatory oversight of financial institutions
* **Access logging**: Records of when the box was accessed
* **Segregation**: Separation from company premises and other signatories

### 4.2. Privacy boards

Privacy boards are utilized during the Setup Ceremony and key operations because they:
* **Prevent shoulder surfing**: Block visual observation of sensitive information
* **Reduce inadvertent disclosure**: Prevent accidental exposure of seeds or PINs
* **Create physical compartmentalization**: Reinforce the need-to-know principle
* **Signal security awareness**: Create a visible reminder of security requirements

### 4.3. Tamper-evident packaging

Tamper-evident bags are specified for seed phrase storage because they:
* **Provide evidence of interference**: Reveal if someone has attempted to access the contents
* **Create psychological barriers**: Discourage casual tampering attempts
* **Enable periodic verification**: Allow confirmation that materials remain secure
* **Document chain of custody**: Through seals and signatures

***

## 5. Software Considerations

### 5.1. Why Electrum?

Electrum was selected as the wallet software for the Cerberus Protocol for several reasons:
* **Mature codebase**: In active development since 2011
* **Strong multisig support**: Purpose-built features for multisignature management
* **Offline capability**: Supports air-gapped transaction signing
* **Open source**: Code available for security review
* **Cross-platform**: Works on various operating systems
* **Hardware wallet integration**: Direct support for Trezor devices
* **Lightweight**: Does not require downloading the entire blockchain

### 5.2. Alternatives considered

Several alternatives were evaluated before selecting Electrum:
* **Hardware vendor software**: Too limited for robust multisignature support
* **Full nodes (Bitcoin Core)**: Excessive resource requirements and complexity
* **Web wallets**: Insufficient security for institutional holdings
* **Specialized business platforms**: Often proprietary with vendor lock-in

### 5.3. Software security considerations

The protocol addresses software-related risks through:
* **Verification procedures**: Checking software authenticity before use
* **Limited trust model**: Using software primarily as an interface to hardware wallets
* **Update protocols**: Procedures for safely updating while maintaining security
* **Fallback mechanisms**: Alternative methods if software becomes unavailable

***

## 8. Technical Deep Dives

### 8.1. Bitcoin transaction structure

A basic understanding of Bitcoin transaction structure helps in understanding multisignature operations:
* **Inputs**: References to previous transaction outputs now being spent
* **Outputs**: New recipient addresses and amounts
* **Signatures**: Cryptographic proofs authorizing the spending of inputs
* **Script**: Instructions defining how outputs can be spent
* **Fees**: Difference between input and output amounts

For multisignature transactions, the script requires multiple valid signatures before funds can be spent.

### 8.2. Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets

The hardware wallets used in the Cerberus Protocol implement HD wallet technology:
* **Master seed**: The 24-word recovery phrase generates a master private key
* **Derivation paths**: Standardized paths generate predictable key sequences
* **Child keys**: Multiple addresses derived from a single seed
* **Account separation**: Different accounts can be isolated within the same wallet
* **Public derivation**: Extended public keys allow address generation without private keys

This technology allows the wallet to generate many addresses while still only requiring a single 24-word phrase for backup.

### 8.3. Air-gapped signing process

For enhanced security, transactions can be signed using air-gapped methods:
* **Transaction creation**: Initiated on an online computer
* **Transfer to offline**: Via USB or QR code
* **Signing**: Performed on an offline device
* **Return to online**: Signed transaction transferred back to networked computer
* **Broadcasting**: Sending the signed transaction to the network

This process ensures private keys are never exposed to an internet-connected device.
