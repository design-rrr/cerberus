# Cerberus Protocol

![The Cerberus Protocol](/assets/cerberus_title.png)

Welcome to the Cerberus Protocol documentation. This protocol provides a comprehensive security framework designed for organizations seeking institutional-grade cryptocurrency custody without relying on third-party custodians.

## Getting Started

**Start here**: [0. Overview & Quick Reference](/0_quick_reference.md)

This overview provides a complete map of the protocol, key roles and responsibilities, essential equipment requirements, and quick reference guides for critical procedures.

**Next steps**:
1. Review the [1. Introduction](/1_introduction.md) to understand the principles and structure
2. Follow the [2. Preparation](/2_preparation.md) steps to assemble your team and equipment
3. Execute the [3. Setup Ceremony](/3_setup_ceremony.md) to establish your secure multisignature wallet

## Who is Cerberus For?

The Cerberus Protocol is specifically designed for:

* **Organizations**: Companies, foundations, and institutions (rather than individuals)
* **Significant Holdings**: Entities with cryptocurrency assets worth protecting with robust security measures
* **Long-term Storage**: Organizations primarily holding cryptocurrency as an investment rather than for frequent transactions
* **Technical Pragmatists**: Teams that need strong security but don't have specialized cryptocurrency expertise

## Key Benefits

* **Distributed Security**: No single point of failure through 2-of-3 multisignature arrangement
* **Operational Resilience**: Business continuity regardless of personnel changes
* **Physical Security**: Multiple layers of protection for both hardware and recovery information
* **Procedural Controls**: Well-defined roles and processes that minimize human error
* **Independence**: Complete control without reliance on third-party custodians
* **Comprehensive Documentation**: Step-by-step guidance for all operational scenarios

## Core Principles

Throughout the implementation of the Cerberus Protocol, adherence to these core principles is essential:

* **Separation of Duties**: No single individual should have complete control or knowledge
* **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against different types of threats
* **Procedural Discipline**: Strict adherence to documented procedures prevents shortcuts
* **Physical Security**: Both hardware wallets and recovery information must be physically secured
* **Verifiable Execution**: All critical steps must be observable and independently verifiable
* **Minimal Complexity**: Procedures are designed to be as simple as possible while maintaining security

## Minimum Requirements

Implementing the Cerberus Protocol requires:

* Three trusted individuals within your organization (signatories)
* Three hardware wallets (Trezor One)
* Laptop computers for each signatory
* Secure physical storage (home safes and safe deposit boxes)
* Approximately 8-10 hours total time commitment (preparation and setup)
* Various supplementary equipment (detailed in the Preparation section)

## Warnings & Disclaimers

### Liability
The Cerberus protocol is used at your own risk, and the authors and contributors accept no responsibility for any losses incurred as part of the protocol's usage.

### Legal Support
Although the Cerberus Protocol is designed to minimize potential conflicts, it should be supported by robust legal agreements between employees and the organization, outlining each participant's obligations for the responsible management of funds. These agreements are beyond the scope of this protocol.

### Version Status
This protocol is under active development. Check for updates regularly and verify you are using the most current version before implementation.
