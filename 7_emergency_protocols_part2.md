Emergency Protocols - Part 2
===========================

![Emergency Protocols - Specific Scenarios](/assets/emergency2.png)

This chapter continues the Emergency Protocols section, focusing on specific emergency scenarios that may affect your organization's cryptocurrency holdings. These protocols should be implemented in conjunction with the Emergency Response Team (ERT) activation described in [Emergency Protocols - Part 1](/6_emergency_protocols_part1.md).

## 1. Critical Personnel Event Response

* [ ] **1.1. Loss of a single signatory**

If a signatory becomes immediately unavailable (arrest, injury, death, etc.):
* Activate the standard Recovery Procedures for Signatory Unavailability
* Document the circumstances of unavailability
* Expedite the selection of a replacement signatory if appropriate

* [ ] **1.2. Loss of multiple signatories**

If two or more signatories become unavailable simultaneously:
* Activate the ERT immediately
* Secure all remaining hardware wallets and seed phrases
* Execute emergency fund transfer if authorized
* Begin accelerated signatory replacement procedure

* [ ] **1.3. Accelerated signatory replacement**

In emergency situations only:
* Executive leadership nominates temporary replacement signatories
* Temporary signatories must meet all standard security requirements
* Conduct an abbreviated Setup Ceremony
* Create a new multisig wallet and transfer funds
* As soon as practical, conduct a standard Setup Ceremony with permanent replacements

***

## 2. Extortion Response

* [ ] **2.1. Immediate actions**

If a signatory or the organization receives an extortion attempt:
* Do not respond to the extortionist
* Contact law enforcement immediately
* Activate the ERT
* Secure all hardware wallets and seed phrases
* Document all communications from the extortionist

* [ ] **2.2. Security assessment**

The ERT should determine:
* Whether the extortionist has actual access to sensitive information
* Which components of the system may be compromised
* The credibility of the threat

* [ ] **2.3. Response strategy**

Based on the assessment:
* If the threat is credible and funds are at risk, execute emergency fund transfer
* If a signatory is under duress, implement signatory replacement
* Follow law enforcement guidance regarding further communications

***

## 3. Force Majeure Response

* [ ] **3.1. Disaster preparedness**

In the event of impending natural disaster, civil unrest, or similar threats:
* Signatories should secure their hardware wallets on their person
* If safe deposit boxes may be inaccessible, consider temporary recovery of seed phrases
* Establish a secondary meeting location outside the affected area

* [ ] **3.2. Relocation procedure**

If physical location is compromised:
* Signatories should evacuate to the pre-designated secondary location
* Bring all hardware wallets and, if possible, seed phrases
* Do not risk personal safety to recover cryptocurrency components
* Contact other signatories once in a secure location

* [ ] **3.3. System restoration**

Once signatories are safe:
* Assemble available components
* Assess which parts of the system remain intact
* If sufficient components remain, execute emergency fund transfer to a safe location
* Begin recovery procedures for any lost components

***

## 4. System Failure Response

* [ ] **4.1. Technical failure assessment**

If normal transaction procedures fail due to technical issues:
* Document the specific errors or failures
* Determine whether the issue is with hardware wallets, software, or blockchain
* Attempt basic troubleshooting (restart devices, update software)

* [ ] **4.2. Alternative access methods**

If standard methods fail:
* Attempt transaction creation with alternate software (compatible with Trezor)
* Use the direct web interface for the hardware wallet if available
* Consider recovery to a different hardware wallet model

* [ ] **4.3. Last resort recovery**

If all electronic methods fail:
* Assemble all signatories in a secure location
* Recover private keys using seed phrases under strict security controls
* Create transaction using alternative methods
* Immediately create new wallets and seed phrases once the emergency is resolved

***

## 5. Duress Protocol

* [ ] **5.1. Recognizing duress situations**

Situations where a signatory may be under duress include:
* Physical threats to the signatory or their family
* Kidnapping or hostage scenarios
* Forced access to secure facilities or hardware
* Unusual and urgent requests that deviate from standard procedures

* [ ] **5.2. Pre-established duress signals**

Each signatory should establish:
* A verbal duress phrase that can be incorporated into normal conversation
* A digital duress signal (specific text message or email phrasing)
* A procedural signal (intentionally skipping a verification step)

* [ ] **5.3. Response to duress signals**

If a duress signal is detected:
* Do not acknowledge recognition of the duress signal
* Activate the ERT immediately without alerting the threatening party
* Contact law enforcement
* Implement emergency fund transfer protocols if necessary
* Prioritize human safety over asset protection

***

## 6. Emergency Drills and Preparedness

* [ ] **6.1. Regular simulation exercises**

At least twice per year, conduct emergency drills to practice:
* ERT activation and communication
* Emergency fund transfers
* Duress signal recognition and response
* System restoration from backups

* [ ] **6.2. Scenario-based training**

Develop and practice responses to specific scenarios:
* Compromise of a single signatory's hardware wallet
* Simultaneous unavailability of two signatories
* Loss of access to primary meeting facilities
* Software or hardware failures during critical transactions

* [ ] **6.3. Documentation and improvement**

After each drill:
* Document response times and procedural gaps
* Update protocols based on lessons learned
* Review and revise emergency contact information
* Ensure all signatories are familiar with updated procedures

***

**Important:** The most effective emergency response is the one prepared in advance. Ensure all signatories are thoroughly familiar with these protocols through regular review and practice.
